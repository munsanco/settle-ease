# SettleEase

We are creating a Java microservice for a trucking company called "SettleEase". The microservice will read CSV files from an FTP server, process the data, and store it in a database. The microservice will be designed to dynamically handle various types of reports, ensuring flexibility in processing different datasets. However, the main goal of this use case is to automate the process of assigning data to individual contractors for settlement deductions through a "Fuel Report", providing transparency and eliminating manual effort.
